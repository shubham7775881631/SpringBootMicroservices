*****1. Always formatting under logger.info*****

//1.Non-Complainant Solution
log.info("The message is logged " + new Date());

//2. Complaint Solution
log.info("The message is logged {}" ,new Date());

The reason, avoid unwanted usage of string constant pool in heap memory.

suppose we have move logger to error level. now we dont need info logging

1. This code will do the concatenation first and then check the like which logger is enabled either error or info
but it executing concatenation and created uncessoru dump in the string constant pool of heap memory

2. this block of code will check the logger itself firsy then try to concatenatate or like avoid the dump in the string constant pool in the heap memory


****** 2. Use PreparedSatement Sql compliation and yo avoid sql injectionâ€ ******
